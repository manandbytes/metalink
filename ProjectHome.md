Metalink is open standard file format for programs that download, including download managers, BitTorrent clients, Web browsers, FTP clients, and P2P programs. It stores the multiple download locations for a file (FTP/HTTP/P2P) in a single metafile with the extension .metalink. This provides reliability in case one method fails. For fast Internet connections, it also speeds up the process by allowing chunks/segments of each file to be downloaded from multiple resources at the same time (segmented downloading).
